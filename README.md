# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ Elevate AI ML INTERNSHIP Task 1

## Objective
Learn how to clean and prepare raw data for machine learning by performing key preprocessing.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn[file:1]

## Task Steps
1. Imported and explored the dataset (checked nulls, data types).
2. Handled missing values using mean/median imputation.
3. Converted categorical features to numerical values using encoding.
4. Normalized and standardized numerical features.
5. Visualized outliers with boxplots and removed them.

## Skills Practiced
- Data cleaning and handling nulls.
- Categorical feature encoding.
- Feature scaling (normalization/standardization)
- Outlier detection and removal
